I&#39;m planning on using data from Kenya&#39;s Open Data Initiative. The first dataset that I&#39;m using is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.opendata.go.ke/Natural-Disasters/1999-2013-National-Natural-Disaster-Inventory/8kdj-377j">1999-2013 National Natural Disaster Inventory dataset</a>.&nbsp;I will merge this data&nbsp;with other datasets on Kenya&#39;s Open Data platform that provide data at the country or district level.</p><p>What do you know about the data so far?</p><p>I have pretty detailed data about natural disasters in Kenya by county, district, and time. There are also multiples variables I can use for the response, such as: injured, missing, houses destroyed, houses damaged, victims, or affected.</p><p>There are also other datasets on Kenya&#39;s Open Data platform that provide data on characteristics at the county/district level. I can merge those datasets with this one to provide more variables I can use as predictors.</p><p>Why did you choose this topic?</p><p>I studied international economics in college, so I&#39;m curious about topics like these. Plus, it could provide important insights into how Kenya should allocate resources across districts and for different natural disasters.</p></body></html>
